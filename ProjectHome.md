  * Almost all deployment configuration including thread count, heap size, FT configuration can be configured with single .ini file.
  * Enable multiple target deployment with single archive file.(like Makefile)
  * Centralized gloabal-variable management
  * Enable remote deployment with single command (support multiple proxy hosts via telnet)
